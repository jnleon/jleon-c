Congratulations!

You are writing a console application for a baseball coach.

The application should ask the coach how many players are on her team. 

For each player, the application should ask for the players name, number of times at bat, and number of hits.

The application should then print the name and batting average of each player.

Lastly, the application should print the player's name and batting average for the player with the highest batting average. 
In case of a tie, the first player entered should be the one that prints.

Notes: this application does NOT need to worry with making sure that user input is the correct TYPE. So if we ask for an int, we can 
assume that the user enters an int. BUT, we cannot assume that the user enters data taht makes sense so we should check that.
