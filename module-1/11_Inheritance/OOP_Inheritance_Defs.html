	<h1> In OOP, there are three fundamental principles:
	</h1>
	<h2> <em>Encapsulation</em></h2>
	<h2> <em>Polymorphism</em></h2>
	<h2> In OOP, <em>Inheritance</em> is the mechanism of basing a class upon another class
	   retaining similar implementation. <br>Also defined as deriving new classes (sub classes) from existing ones base class
		and then forming them into a hierarchy of classes. <br>
		In most class-based object-oriented languages, an object created through inheritance, a "child object", acquires all the properties
		 and behaviors of the "parent object" , with the exception of constructors and a few others (none of which we talk about at TE)

	<ul>
		<li>Virtual: on the parent, this means that child classes are allowed to override</li>
		<li>Abstract: on the parent, this means that child classes are required to override</li>
