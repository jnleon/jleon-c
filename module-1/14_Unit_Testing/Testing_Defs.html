    <h1> Automated vs Manual
    </h1>
    <h2> <em>Automated testing </em></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Speed / Efficiency
        </li>
        <li>
            Lower cost of execution
        </li>
        <li>
            Accuracy
        </li>
        <li>
            Dependability / Repeatability
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2> <em>Manual testing </em></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Creativity
        </li>
        <li>
          Can evaluate subjective qualities (e.g. user friendliness, usability)
        </li>
    </ul>
<h1>Exploratory vs Regression</h1>
      
    <h2> <em>Exploratory Testing</em> explores the functionality of the system looking for defects, missing features, or other opportunities for improvement.  Almost always manual.</h2>
    <h2> <em>Regression Testing</em> validates that existing functionality continues to operate as expected.</h2>

<h1>
    Unit, Integration, and Acceptance Testing
</h1>
<h2>As you progress from Unit Testing -> Integration Testing -> Acceptance Testing: </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>longer runtime</li>
        <li>more expensive to write </li>
        <li>harder to troubleshoot</li>

    </ul>



    <h2> <em>Acceptance Testing</em> is performed from the perspective of a user of the system in order to verify that the functionality of the system satisfies user needs.</h2>
    <h2> <em>Integration Testing</em> is a broad category of tests that validate the integration between units of code or code and outside dependencies such as databases or network resources.</h2>
    <h2> <em>Unit Testing</em> is low level of testing performed by programmers that validates individual "<em>units</em>" of code <em>function as intended by the programmer</em>. Always automated.  </h2>
