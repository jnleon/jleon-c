    <h1> Types of Errors </h1>
    <h2>A <em>compile-time error </em>occurs when there is a syntactical error or the compiler
         identifies code that cannot execute (e.g. method does not exist, accessibility not public, 
         redefined constant, type mismatch). Usually indicated by the red squiggly underline.</h2>
    <h2> A <em>run-time error </em>occurs while the program is executing. The program often tries to access memory 
        that is inaccessible or may be asked to perform an operation it is incapable of 
        (e.g. access a restricted file, parse a value) </h2>
    <h1><em>Exception handling</em> is the process of responding to exceptional errors in the programming. This processing
         often changes the flow of the program so that it can recover.</h1>
    <h1>File IO</h1>
    <h2>A <em>stream</em> refers to a sequence of bytes that can read and write to some sort of backing data store.</h2>
    <h2>Exceptions can often occur when reading streams</h2>
    <ul>
       <li> Directory not found</li>
       <li>End of stream reached
       <li>File not found</li>
       <li>Path too long (windows only)</li>
    </ul>
