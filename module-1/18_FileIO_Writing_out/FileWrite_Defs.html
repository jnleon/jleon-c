    <h1>A <em>buffer</em> contains data that is stored for a short amount of time, 
        typically in the computer's memory (RAM). The purpose of a buffer is to hold
         data right before it is used.  </h1>
         <h2>
         A buffer is like a bucket you catch water in. Once the bucket is full, you can dump it out, ready to be filled again.
        </h2>
        <h1>Using StreamWriter</h1>
        <h2>Content is buffered and not saved (or cannot be seen) until the stream is flushed or disposed.</h2>
        <h2>Flushing a buffer means transmitting any accumulated character output to a file.</h2>
