Today we are going to implement a caesar cipher - one of the simplest encryption techniques. It's a substitution
cipher where each letter is replaced by another left a fixed number of positions away.

Our application should: 

1. Prompt the user for the file to encryption. Prompt the user for the file name to save the encryption as.
2. Prompt the user for the number of positions to shift
3. "Encrypt" the file by shifting every character the number of positions to shift and save in the new file
4. Give the user a message that it's done.
